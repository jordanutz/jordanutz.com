                Web application that generates the three day weather forecast
                using the WeatherAPI. The user can search by city and state or
                zip code to retrieve forecast for their location. Cards used to
                render the three day forecast, active defaulting to the current
                date. â€‹

                of an operant. Validation states applied to buttons to ensure
                that user error is minimized.

                Intuitive trivia game that tests players on their knowledge of
                video games with questions retrieved from the Open Trivia API.
                Visual cues are leveraged to alert the player if their selection
                is correct or incorrect, and their progress is tracked with each
                question.
